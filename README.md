## Project status

[Here](https://github.com/crackededed/Xtra) is the actively maintained fork by crackededed with a lot of new features and improvements. In February 2022 older versions will stop working due to deprecated Twitch API used in the app getting shutdown. So if you want to continue using Xtra, please download the APKs from crackededed's repo, which have the new API already implemented.

The app was removed from Google Play in April 2021. After that and Twitch constantly messing with their streams API and spamming ads, I unfortunately lost my passion for the project, but anyone is welcomed to make a contribution or share your forked versions on the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/XtraForTwitch).
